# Employee-Directory

## Overview
This application serves as an employee directory with use of React. The UI is broken down into components where the component state is   managed and is able to respond to user events.

## User Story

As a USER, I WANT to be able to view my entire employee directory at once SO THAT I have quick access to their information.


## Business Context
An employee or manager would benefit greatly from being able to view non-sensitive data about other employees. It would be particularly helpful to be able to filter employees by name.

## Acceptance Criteria
Given a table of random users, when the user loads the page, a table of employees should render.
The user should be able to:

Sort the table by at least one category
Filter the users by at least one property.
